# Ai-Fake-News-Detection


An AI-powered web app that detects and classifies fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🚧 Status
**In progress** — currently refining models and improving accuracy.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ Preprocesses and cleans text data (removes stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
- ✅ Vectorizes text using TF-IDF
- ✅ Classifies articles as **Fake** or **Real**
- 🔄 Web interface for user input and results
- 🔄 Model comparison and performance metrics display

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **NLP**: NLTK or spaCy
- **Web Framework**: Flask or Django (TBD)  
- **Model Types**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

## 📈 Dataset
- public datasets such as `Fake.csv` from Kaggle

## ⚙️ How It Works (Coming Soon)
1. User enters or uploads an article  
2. Text is preprocessed and transformed  
3. ML model makes prediction  
4. Result shown with confidence level

## 📌 To-Do
- [ ] Finalize dataset and preprocessing pipeline  
- [ ] Tune and compare multiple models  
- [ ] Build frontend interface (Flask/Streamlit)  
- [ ] Display model performance metrics  
- [ ] Add model saving/loading logic
